# Penguin_Classification_Model
This is a machine learning model to classify penguins in Antarctica into three species-Adelie penguins, Emperor penguins and Gentoo penguins. The classification is done based on characteristics like island(habitat),sex, flipper length, culmen length and depth. I used logistic regression algorithm for the classification
